#  ProgSysLabs
8 hours to develop a Linux Shell

During those 2 lab sessions, we had the opportunity to delve deeper into various functiuons that were initially introduced in class.
These functions such as write, read, open and creat.
While basic understanding of these functions was straightforward, the challenge layed in comprehending the arguments required for these functions.
Additionally, we were introduced to new commands like strtok, clock_gettime, and dup2.
The labs served as a practical application to not only understand these functions and commands but also to comprehend their purpose in coding.
For example, the fork function which utility was unclear became clearer as we realized it's role in crucial apllications such as creating a shell.
Those labs were not without their challenges. 
The third and fourth questions, in particular, posed a considerable difficulty. 
This was our first encounter with real challenges, primarily because we had to search for specific functions and learn their usage. 
For instance, in question 4, we had to understand the use of WIFEXITED and WIFSIGNALED, and also consider using the sprintf function.
Or even in question 3 where we had to understand how to exit with the command <ctrl> +d.
And finally also question 7, as we finally were able to create a new file or open a existing one but in the end as an instructions like ls > file.txt the terminal don't work anymore no commands works.
We think that it comes from the fact that the file doesn't close itself properly but it is there in the code so in the end no solutions were found.
In summary, these labs were instrumental in enhancing our understanding of the functions and code discussed in class. 
They also highlighted the challenges faced during the creation of a shell in C, thereby providing a comprehensive learning experience.
